# Online Retail Store - Final Project for CS 201 (IT21S1)

## Project Overview
This project is the final submission for CS 201, Data Structures and Algorithms, for section IT21S1. It focuses on creating an **Online Retail Store** with a functional system for managing a product catalog, shopping cart, and order processing. The project demonstrates the use of various data structures such as HashMap, ArrayList, and Queue to handle the core functionalities of an online retail store.

## Project Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are to:
- Develop a product catalog using **HashMap** for storing product details and pricing.
- Implement a shopping cart using **ArrayList** to manage items added to the cart.
- Process orders with a **Queue** to ensure orders are handled on a first-come, first-served basis.
- Integrate inventory management to track stock levels dynamically.
- Create a user interface (GUI) for browsing products, managing the cart, and completing orders.

## Project Components
### 1. **Product Catalog**
   - Uses **HashMap** to store product information with unique product IDs.
   - Includes methods for adding, updating, and removing products.

### 2. **Shopping Cart**
   - Utilizes **ArrayList** to manage items selected by the user.
   - Provides functionality to add, remove, and update item quantities.

### 3. **Order Processing**
   - Employs a **Queue** to manage order processing and payment handling.
   - Ensures that orders are processed in the order they are received.

### 4. **Inventory Management**
   - Tracks stock levels for each product.
   - Updates inventory dynamically based on orders placed.

### 5. **User Interface (GUI)**
   - Built using Java Swing/JavaFX for an interactive experience.
   - Allows users to view products, add them to the cart, and complete orders.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/online-retail-store.git
   ```
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse).
3. Compile and run the `Main` class to launch the application.

## Usage
